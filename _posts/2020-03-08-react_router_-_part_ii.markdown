As I mentioned on my first post, I have a login page as my first page to login to my app, and after login, I would like to have my page to redirect to the Home page for the logined user. all the Information relating to that login user would be displayed in the home page. However, I still can not figure out to do it. I am still working on it. It should be an easy routing issue, however, I just do not get it at this monent.
