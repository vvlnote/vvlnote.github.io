## Final project
Time is flying, the couses are all finished, time for us to put all our knowledge what we learned from the past few months into the final project. It should be a fun journey!

## Project - 
This project is helping a small cafe (not as formal as restaurant) to track the food ingredients consummation.
### Database:

       - id : assigned by database when a new record is created
       - name
       - unit cost
       - available amount
       - alert low amount

- dishes: this is the manu of the dishes this cafe provides
      - name:
      - price
